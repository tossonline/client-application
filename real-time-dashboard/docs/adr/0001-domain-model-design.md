# ADR 1: Domain Model Design

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Real-Time Analytics Platform requires a robust domain model that can efficiently handle:
- Real-time event tracking and processing
- Complex analytics calculations
- Player lifecycle management
- Customizable dashboards
- Performance at scale

We needed to decide on the core domain entities, their relationships, and responsibilities while ensuring the model supports both current requirements and future extensibility.

## Decision

We decided to implement a domain model with the following key entities:

1. **PixelEvent**
   - Represents raw event data
   - Immutable after creation
   - Factory methods for different event types
   - Rich metadata support
   - Validation rules

2. **EventSummary**
   - Aggregates events by time period
   - Supports multiple aggregation levels
   - Optimized for querying
   - Mergeable for parallel processing

3. **DailyMetric**
   - Pre-calculated daily metrics
   - Trend tracking
   - Rate calculations
   - Performance indicators

4. **Player**
   - Rich lifecycle management
   - Value tracking
   - Segmentation rules
   - Activity monitoring

5. **Dashboard**
   - Flexible configuration
   - Widget-based layout
   - Multiple dashboard types
   - Real-time updates

Key design decisions:
- Use of factory methods for entity creation
- Private setters for immutability
- Rich domain logic in entities
- Value objects for common concepts
- Domain events for state changes

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Clean Domain Model**
   - Clear responsibilities
   - Strong encapsulation
   - Rich domain logic
   - Type safety

2. **Performance**
   - Efficient querying through summaries
   - Optimized aggregations
   - Scalable design

3. **Maintainability**
   - Easy to extend
   - Well-documented
   - Testable design
   - Clear boundaries

4. **Business Alignment**
   - Reflects business concepts
   - Supports business rules
   - Clear lifecycle management
   - Flexible reporting

### Negative

1. **Complexity**
   - More complex than anemic model
   - Learning curve for new developers
   - More code to maintain

2. **Performance Trade-offs**
   - Storage overhead for summaries
   - Additional processing for aggregations
   - Memory usage for rich objects

3. **Development Overhead**
   - More initial development time
   - More thorough testing required
   - Documentation needs

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Anemic Domain Model**
   - Simpler implementation
   - Less domain logic
   - More procedural
   - Rejected due to maintainability concerns

2. **Event Sourcing**
   - Complete event history
   - Complex implementation
   - Higher resource usage
   - Rejected as overly complex for requirements

3. **CQRS Split**
   - Separate read/write models
   - Additional complexity
   - Eventual consistency
   - Kept as future option

## Implementation Notes

1. **Entity Creation**
   ```csharp
   // Factory methods for controlled creation
   public static PixelEvent CreateVisit(string playerId, string bannerTag)
   ```

2. **Immutability**
   ```csharp
   // Private setters for immutability
   public string EventType { get; private set; }
   ```

3. **Rich Domain Logic**
   ```csharp
   // Business logic in entities
   public void UpdateSegment()
   ```

4. **Value Objects**
   ```csharp
   // Value objects for common concepts
   public enum TimePeriod { Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly }
   ```

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Sharding strategies
   - Caching layers
   - Parallel processing

2. **Extensions**
   - Machine learning integration
   - Advanced analytics
   - Real-time predictions

3. **Integration**
   - External system integration
   - API versioning
   - Data export/import
